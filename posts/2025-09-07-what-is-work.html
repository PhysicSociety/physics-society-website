  <h1>What Is Work, Really?</h1>
  <small>By Physics Society • 2025-09-07</small>
  <hr>

  <p>Most people define work as “the thing I do for money.” That’s practical, but incomplete. For me, work is <em>whatever gives you purpose</em> — the reason you get out of bed, the thing that keeps you up late because you can’t stop thinking about it.</p>

  <p>I’ve had jobs that didn’t meet that definition. Sometimes you take work to survive, and that’s valid. But if money is your only motivator, it buys only shallow dreams. Purpose is what turns life from a grind into a story worth living.</p>

  <h2>The Power of Dreaming</h2>
  <p>People often say, “Not everyone has the privilege to chase their dreams.” I get that. But if we abandon dreaming entirely, what’s left? We’d be living in a world where people have quietly stopped imagining something better — and yet, we all know individuals who <em>have</em> built lives they once only dreamed about.</p>

  <p>Dreaming isn’t reserved for the rich. It’s free, it’s universal, and it’s essential. Dreams may feel out of reach, but they’re also the seeds of change.</p>

  <h2>Timber, Spark, and Air</h2>
  <p>Dreams are the timber. You are the spark. Luck is the air that fuels the fire.<br>
  All three are intertwined: you need a vision, you need action, and yes, sometimes you need a gust of fortune. Without dreaming, the fire never starts. Without effort, it dies. Without opportunity, it struggles to grow.</p>

  <h2>What I Want From Life</h2>
  <p>What do I want? To wake up excited. To go to bed fulfilled. To spend my days immersed in things that matter to me. That’s it.</p>

  <p>For me, that means redefining work: not just what I <em>do</em> to earn money, but what I <em>choose</em> to pour my energy into. That’s how I avoid living a life of quiet despair.</p>

  <p><strong>So here’s the question I’ll leave you with:</strong><br>
  What do <em>you</em> want out of life, and are you brave enough to build it?</p>
